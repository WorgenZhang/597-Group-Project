Guys, some good news, I just asked the prof. kuan: 1. We don't need to compare different methods. 2. We don't need to create confidence interval. 3. In Weighted Z-test, we can just select one scenario. (Weifan's code is suitable for just using square root of sample size as weighting method). 4. We just need to print some message to tell users like "We recommend using which method since...". So congratulations, we are almost done for this project. It's so successful.
